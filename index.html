			<h1>Control your computer with your phone?</h1>
			<p>
				Today I'll be talking about this app called: Remote Mouse. It
				allows your mobile device or tablet to control your computer,
				like a mouse, keyboard, or trackpad. Let me show you how it
				works. You need to download the app on your phone and get a
				server running on your computer. It's available for iOS,
				Android, Windows, and Mac. I like how low-latency it is. It
				actually depends on whether you're using Bluetooth or WiFi. The
				WiFi connection seems super fast, while the Bluetooth one seems
				to struggle a bit, so I recommend using WiFi.
